                This is a collection of my notes for React. You can see the notes on specific topics by selecting them
                on the sidebar, some of the topics have examples with code provided while others just have handy
                information. The source code for this entire page can be found here and each of the topics will have
                links to their specific directories within the repo. I'm also planning on adding a sandbox for each example
                down the line so depending on how far along it is there may be a sandbox link provided as well.
